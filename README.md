 #--Short Introduction--#
 
 
 The "Showcase Bookstore" is a small book and video lending company. Only registered customers 
can borrow books and videos. To allow members to access this service online, we created a web 
application. This includes an online reading/movie-watching platform. Additionally, admins will 
have a role in this application to manage the bookstore's members and books. 

Spring Boot, HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Java EE features were used to create the web application. The IDE used
to develop this web app was IntelliJ Ultimate, and a relational database, MySQL, was used to store 
the user and book data.

Admin can use this web application to manage books, members, notify members, and manage 
member complaints and messages, while members can view books, add books to favorites, remove 
books from favorites, read books online, reserve a book, return a book, contact admin, view 
notifications, and view profiles.
